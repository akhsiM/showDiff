# Overview

At my job, one area that I support involves looking at and comparing big batch files. Before writing this I relied solely on VS Code. However there are certain limitations.

What this script does is to compare two files (file1 and file2). It then:
- print the count of differences 
- generate a diff file that contains the data in the following format:
  `{text line} - {file1|file2}`

# Instructions

---
**Note**

File 1 and File 2 has to be in plain text format. csv and txt are fine.

---

- Download **diff.py** to the same folder where both file 1 and file 2 resides.
- Run diff.py, enter/ paste filename 1 and filename 2.
- Profit
